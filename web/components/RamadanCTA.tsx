          Imagine standing in Taraweeh and actually recognizing the words being
          recited. Not just hearing beautiful sounds — but understanding the
          meaning behind them.

          Start before Ramadan. By the time it begins, you&apos;ll already know
          dozens of Quranic words. Every night of Taraweeh becomes more
          meaningful.
