# Product Goals

## Vision
Help Pakistani Muslims finally understand the Arabic they already recite — by teaching Qur'anic vocabulary word by word, building toward real comprehension of the Qur'an and daily prayers.

## The Problem
230M+ Muslims in Pakistan. Most recite the Qur'an and pray in Arabic daily without understanding a single word. This is a deeply felt gap — emotional, spiritual, and personal. Existing solutions are either too expensive, too academic, teach the wrong kind of Arabic (conversational instead of Qur'anic), or don't reach Pakistani users effectively.

## Who Is the User
- Pakistani Muslims (ages 18-45 primary, all ages secondary)
- Digitally active, English-comfortable (uses apps, YouTube, Instagram in English)
- Can read Arabic script (completed Nazra as children) but have zero comprehension
- Pray regularly, recite Qur'an, but feel disconnected from meaning
- Smartphone users (mostly Android, budget-mid range)
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for genuine value
- Motivated by spiritual growth, especially during Ramadan
- Active on Instagram — this is where they share and discover
- Secondary audience: Pakistani diaspora (UK, Middle East, North America)

## What Winning Looks Like
- Users build a growing word bank AND grammar pattern knowledge — real comprehension, not just recognition
- Word count + pattern count become social currency — people flex on Instagram and in real-life gatherings
- Founder-led content drives awareness and trust pre-Ramadan
- 40%+ Day-30 retention (words + grammar payoff supports this)
- 5-10% free-to-premium conversion (grammar insights + practice mode drive this)
- Recognized as the go-to Qur'anic Arabic app in Pakistan within 12 months
- Revenue-sustainable through premium subscriptions without compromising the spiritual mission
- Users open the Qur'an and actually parse basic sentences — the emotional payoff that no competitor delivers

## What We Will NOT Do
- Will NOT teach Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or conversational Arabic
- Will NOT build a purely Urdu interface — English flow, Urdu as a learning aid only
- Will NOT make the learning path surah-based — learning is word-centric with grammar woven in
- Will NOT run ads inside the app — religious content stays ad-free
- Will NOT paywall Qur'anic vocabulary — words are free forever, premium unlocks grammar/practice/review
- Will NOT build for the global market first — Pakistan is the focus
- Will NOT over-gamify — this is spiritual learning, not a game
- Will NOT use guilt-based upselling — "don't you want to learn the Quran?" is never acceptable
- Will NOT teach grammar as a separate course — grammar is woven into word lessons as "Arabic Insights"
