# Product Goals

## Vision
Help Pakistani Muslims finally understand the Arabic they already recite — by teaching Qur'anic vocabulary word by word, building toward real comprehension of the Qur'an and daily prayers.

## The Problem
230M+ Muslims in Pakistan. Most recite the Qur'an and pray in Arabic daily without understanding a single word. This is a deeply felt gap — emotional, spiritual, and personal. Existing solutions are either too expensive, too academic, teach the wrong kind of Arabic (conversational instead of Qur'anic), or don't reach Pakistani users effectively.

## Who Is the User
- Pakistani Muslims (ages 18-45 primary, all ages secondary)
- Digitally active, English-comfortable (uses apps, YouTube, Instagram in English)
- Can read Arabic script (completed Nazra as children) but have zero comprehension
- Pray regularly, recite Qur'an, but feel disconnected from meaning
- Smartphone users (mostly Android, budget-mid range)
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for genuine value
- Motivated by spiritual growth, especially during Ramadan
- Active on Instagram — this is where they share and discover
- Secondary audience: Pakistani diaspora (UK, Middle East, North America)

## What Winning Looks Like
- Users build a growing word bank and can feel real progress (word count)
- Word count becomes social currency — people flex it on Instagram and in real-life gatherings
- Founder-led content drives awareness and trust pre-Ramadan
- 40%+ Day-30 retention (the word-by-word payoff supports this)
- 10-15% free-to-premium conversion
- Recognized as the go-to Qur'anic Arabic app in Pakistan within 12 months
- Revenue-sustainable through premium subscriptions without compromising the spiritual mission

## What We Will NOT Do
- Will NOT teach Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or conversational Arabic
- Will NOT build a purely Urdu interface — English flow, Urdu as a learning aid only
- Will NOT make the learning path surah-based — learning is word-centric
- Will NOT run ads inside the app — religious content stays ad-free
- Will NOT put basic learning behind a paywall (Module 1 is free, genuinely valuable)
- Will NOT build for the global market first — Pakistan is the focus
- Will NOT over-gamify — this is spiritual learning, not a game
- Will NOT launch with more than Module 1 — validate first, expand later
