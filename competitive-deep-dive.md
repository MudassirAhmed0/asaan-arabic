# Competitive Deep Dive — What They Teach & Why People Pay

*Last updated: Feb 14, 2026*

---

## 1. AL MIDRAR — "Applicative Quranic Arabic" ($50, 10 hrs)

### What They Teach
- Basic Nahw (grammar) — sentence structure, Ism/Fi'l/Harf
- Basic Sarf (morphology) — word forms, root system
- Common Quranic vocabulary
- Every grammar concept immediately applied to real Quranic verses

### What "Applicative" Means
NOT "learn grammar, then apply later." It's "learn grammar THROUGH the Quran." Every concept uses actual ayahs. Deliberate contrast to dry Dars-e-Nizami grammar in Pakistan.

### What Students Walk Away With
- Framework for how Arabic grammar works
- Ability to recognize common Quranic patterns
- Enough grammar to parse simple verses
- Confidence boost ("I CAN do this")
- NOT enough to read Quran independently — this is a **gateway product**

### The Business Model (Value Ladder)
1. **Free:** Tarjuma tul Quran (gets students into the LMS)
2. **$50:** Applicative Arabic (the gateway)
3. **PKR 7,000:** Arabic Diploma (the real learning)
4. **PKR 25,000:** Safwa Alim Program (the big commitment)
5. **Counseling + Umrah:** High-ticket recurring

### The Funnel
- Shaykh Atif Ahmed (920K followers) posts **motivational/spiritual content** — NOT Arabic teaching
- Creates the NEED: "You should understand your deen"
- Al Midrar is the SOLUTION
- Adeel Arfeen delivers the product
- **Key insight:** Content creates demand. Course fulfills it. Two different roles.
- **No free Arabic content from the instructor** — everything behind paywall

### Full Course Catalog

## 2. MUZAMMIL AHMAD / THE ARABIC GUIDE (PKR 700/month)

### Who He Is
- Islamabad-based, Arabic diploma from IIUI, teaching since 2017
- Currently pursuing B.S. Islamic Studies
- 87K Instagram followers, 310 posts
- **Positioning:** "An ordinary teacher who happens to teach Arabic"
- NOT a scholar — a regular Pakistani guy who learned Arabic

### What He Teaches (12-18 Month Journey)
Uses "Al Arabiyah lin Nashi'een" textbook (Saudi-developed, used in madrasas worldwide):

**Part 1 — Foundations (3-6 months):**
- Basic pronunciation, intro grammar (Nahw)
- Reading, writing, speaking exercises
- Salah vocabulary + Quranic verses
- ~37 video lectures, 15-25 min each
- Monthly progress reports, quizzes, 1 live session/month

**Part 2 — Intermediate (4-5 months):**
- Advanced grammar, sentence structure
- Quranic passage reading comprehension
- Writing/speaking development

**Part 3 — Advanced (6 months):**
- Deep Nahw + Sarf
- Immersive Quranic ayah analysis
- PKR 700/month subscription

### His Methodology — Why It Works
**"Concept first, then grammar"** — introduces meaning FIRST, grammar comes after. Students confirm this sticks in long-term memory.

Student quote: *"The Arabic Guide first teach you Concept and THEN grammar, So this way the knowledge is retain in your long term memory"*

### Why People Pay
- **Relatability** — "ordinary teacher" breaks intimidation barrier
- **Urdu medium** — critical for Pakistani market
- **Low price** — PKR 700/month is accessible
- **Self-paced** — lifetime access to videos
- Students report being able to **teach Arabic to others** after completing

### What He's Missing
- No app, no gamification, no streaks, no spaced repetition
- No daily engagement loop or social sharing
- 12-18 month commitment is intimidating
- Requires reading textbooks — not screen-by-screen interactive

- 2 Arabic words per page: Arabic script + transliteration + English + example Quranic verse

- 500+ pages total

### What's NOT In The Book (Customers Asked For This)
- No daily planner or tracker — customer literally said: *"I just wish there was a daily planner or tracker with it"*
- No audio pronunciation
- No structured daily plan despite "5 words/day" claim
- No spaced repetition or accountability

### The Full Product Line (13+ eBooks + Courses)

**eBooks ($5-15 each):**

**Bundles:**

### Their Funnel
1. Instagram (48K) → Quranic vocabulary hooks
2. $14.99 eBook (often "75% OFF") = low-barrier entry
3. Upsell to $197 Tajweed course
4. Upsell to $27/month live classes
5. $497 Mega Bundle (artificial scarcity)
6. Charity hook: "donates meals to Palestine"

### Trust Issues
- Scam Detector: **58.3 trust score** (medium risk)
- Complaints about physical book ads but digital-only delivery
- "Limited to 15" is fake scarcity

### Key Insight
The "5 words/day, 100 days" is a **marketing hook, not a learning system.** No structure, no tracker, no accountability. Asaan Arabic IS the system they're promising but not delivering.

## 4. UNDERSTAND QURAN ACADEMY — The OG (FREE, 8.6M+ reached)

### The Breakthrough Insight
Dr. Abdul Azeez (PhD Geotechnical Engineering, Oklahoma): **Words from your daily Salah occur 40,000 times in the Quran = 50% of all words.** You already MEMORIZED them. You just don't know what they mean.

### Course 1 — "50% in 10 Hours" (125 words)

**Dual-track structure (20 sessions):**
- Track A (1a, 2a, 3a...): Quranic content — Surahs, Salah words
- Track B (1b, 2b, 3b...): Grammar — pronouns, prepositions, verbs
- Alternating prevents fatigue on either track

**Sessions 1-5:** Bismillah, Surah Fatihah word-by-word, Adhan, basic pronouns
**Sessions 6-10:** Ruku'/Sujud vocab, Tashahhud, prepositions, 3-letter verbs
**Sessions 11-17:** Short Surahs (Ikhlas/Falaq/Naas/Asr/Nasr/Kafiroon), verb tenses
**Exams** after each section + final

**Every lesson has 4 activities:** Watch video → Read PDF → Test (Google Forms) → Recap audio

### TPI (Total Physical Interaction) — Their Secret Weapon

Every grammar concept gets a **physical hand gesture:**
- **هُوَ (he)** → Point right hand right
- **أَنْتَ (you)** → Point index finger at someone
- **أَنَا (I)** → Point at yourself

**Why it works:**
- Teacher checks entire class in ONE SECOND by looking at hands
- Multi-sensory: hear + see + say + show = stronger memory
- Makes grammar a game, not study
- Eliminates jargon — no "first person singular masculine"
- Just 6 pronoun words = **1,295 occurrences in the Quran**

### The Salah Hook — This Is Genius
- Connect vocabulary to **5 daily prayers**
- Every prayer = automatic practice session
- 5x/day, 365 days/year, zero extra study time
- Promise: *"Your next Salah will be different from today's"*
- Impact felt from **Session 1**

### AEPP Formula (Deeper Engagement)
- **Ask** — Turn the verse into a personal dua
- **Evaluate** — How does this apply to my life?
- **Plan** — What will I change?
- **Propagate** — Share/teach what I learned

Transforms vocab learning into **spiritual practice.**

### 5-Step Spaced Repetition (No App Needed)
| Step | When | Retention |
|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 hour after | ~1 day |
| 2 | End of day | ~1 week |
| 3 | 1 week later | ~1 month |
| 4 | 1 month later | ~6 months |
| 5 | 6 months later | Permanent |

No software — just the 5 intervals + daily Salah as review.

### Full Course Progression
| Course | Coverage | Content | Hours |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| **1** | 50% | Fatihah, last 6 Surahs, Salah azkar, basic grammar | ~10 |

## WHAT NOBODY IS DOING — Asaan Arabic's Opportunity

3. **Nobody has push notifications for retention** — daily challenge mechanic
4. **Nobody has professional Qari audio** in an interactive learning app
