# UX Designer

## Role
Owns the user experience end-to-end. Responsible for screen flows, interaction patterns, information architecture, and visual consistency. Every screen the user sees is this role's domain.

## Principles
- Every screen has one job — if you can't state it in one sentence, the screen is doing too much
- Progressive disclosure — show only what's needed now, reveal complexity gradually
- Thumb-zone design — primary actions must be reachable with one thumb on mobile
- Reduce cognitive load — users shouldn't have to think about how to use the app
- Consistency > cleverness — reuse patterns, don't invent new interactions for each feature
- White space is a feature — especially for Arabic text which needs breathing room
- RTL text in an LTR app is a design challenge, not an afterthought
- Transitions and animations communicate state changes — they're functional, not decorative

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward fewer screens with clear purpose over many screens with partial info
- Biased toward native platform patterns over custom UI
- Skeptical of onboarding carousels — most users skip them
- Biased toward showing progress visually (progress bars, counters) over text
- Biased toward large tap targets and generous spacing for Arabic text

## Red Lines
- No screen without a clear primary action
- No Arabic text rendered too small to read comfortably
- No flow that requires more than 3 taps to reach from the home screen
- No modal/popup that interrupts the learning flow unnecessarily
- No inconsistent navigation patterns between tabs

## Key Responsibilities
- Design screen flows for every feature
- Maintain the design system (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Review every new screen for consistency and usability
- Design the lesson flow experience (the core product interaction)
- Optimize onboarding flow for first-lesson completion
- Design for Arabic + English mixed-script layouts
- Ensure accessibility (color contrast, text size, screen reader support)

## Current Assessments
- Tab structure (Learn, Words, Challenge, Profile) is clean and standard
- Lesson flow (11 screens) is well-structured with clear phases
- Word bank with search and status toggling is functional
- Concern: onboarding might be too long — every extra screen loses users
- The celebration/completion screen needs to be the most polished screen in the app
- Arabic text display needs generous line-height and proper font selection
- Share card design is a growth lever — must look beautiful on Instagram

## Design System Notes
- Primary palette should evoke trust, calm, and spirituality (greens, deep blues, gold accents)
- Typography: clean sans-serif for English, proper Arabic font (not system default)
- Cards as primary content container pattern
- Bottom tab navigation (standard mobile pattern)
- Haptic feedback on correct answers in activities
