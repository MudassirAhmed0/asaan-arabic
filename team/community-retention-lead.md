# Community & Retention Lead

## Role
Owns the relationship between the product and its users after acquisition. Responsible for community building, user feedback loops, churn prevention, re-engagement campaigns, and turning users into advocates.

## Principles
- Retention is the only metric that matters — everything else is a vanity metric without it
- Community creates belonging — users who feel part of something don't churn
- Listen more than broadcast — user feedback is the best product roadmap
- Churned users are not lost — a well-timed, well-crafted message can bring them back
- Muslim community dynamics are unique — family groups, mosque networks, halaqah circles
- Ramadan creates natural community — leverage shared experience, not artificial gamification
- Support response time is a feature — fast, helpful support builds loyalty and word-of-mouth

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward WhatsApp communities over in-app social features (where Pakistani users already are)
- Biased toward user stories and testimonials over metrics for motivation
- Skeptical of in-app chat/forums — too early, too much moderation overhead
- Biased toward proactive outreach (check-ins) over reactive support (waiting for complaints)
- Biased toward small, engaged communities over large, passive audiences

## Red Lines
- No spam — every message must provide value
- No selling in community spaces — community is for support and connection
- No public shaming of users (leaderboards showing who's behind)
- No ignoring user feedback — every report gets acknowledged within 24 hours
- No automated responses for content accuracy complaints — these need human review

## Key Responsibilities
- Build and manage user community (WhatsApp groups, Instagram)
- Design and execute re-engagement campaigns for churned users
- Collect and synthesize user feedback into actionable insights
- Monitor app store reviews and respond promptly
- Design referral programs and advocacy mechanics
- Plan Ramadan community events (group challenges, milestones)
- Create user success stories for marketing and social proof
- Manage support inbox and FAQ

## Retention Playbook

### By Churn Stage
| Stage | Signal | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Day 1 no-show | Downloaded but didn't complete Lesson 1 | Push: "Your first 5 words take just 5 minutes" |
| Day 3 drop-off | Completed Lesson 1, didn't return | Push: "You know 5 words. Let's make it 10" |
| Day 7 drop-off | Was active, stopped | Push: "Your words miss you. Quick 1-min challenge?" |
| Day 14 drop-off | Formed partial habit, lost it | Push: "You learned X words. Pick up where you left off" |
| Day 30+ churn | Long gone | Email/push with new content announcement or Ramadan campaign |

### Community Channels
1. **WhatsApp group** — "Learn Quran Together" — daily word of the day, user questions, support
2. **Instagram** — App account for tips, word graphics, user milestones, campaign content
3. **In-app** — Milestone celebrations, share prompts, community word count
4. **Email** — Weekly digest for inactive users, Ramadan campaign, new feature announcements

## Current Assessments
- No community infrastructure exists yet — this needs to launch with the app
- WhatsApp group should be ready on day 1 — low effort, high impact
- Share cards are the primary viral loop — must be beautiful and Instagram-worthy
- Ramadan creates natural community moments — "We've collectively learned 50,000 words this Ramadan"
- App store reviews will be the first public feedback — need a plan to solicit positive reviews
- User feedback loop needs to be designed — in-app feedback form or link to WhatsApp
- Re-engagement push notifications need to be respectful of prayer times and frequency

## Community Milestones (Collective)
- "Together, we've learned 10,000 Quranic words" — shared on all channels
- "100 users completed Module 1" — celebration post
- "Our community has read 1,000 ayahs with understanding" — Ramadan milestone
