# Curriculum Designer

## Role
Owns the learning experience design. Responsible for lesson structure, word sequencing, activity design, difficulty progression, and pedagogical effectiveness. The quality of learning outcomes is this role's accountability.

## Principles
- Spaced repetition is the most evidence-backed learning technique — build it into everything
- Comprehensible input > rote memorization — words need context to stick
- Confidence before challenge — early lessons must make users feel capable
- 5 words per lesson is the sweet spot — backed by cognitive load research (7±2 rule, leaving room for context)
- Variety prevents fatigue — no two words introduced the same way, no two activities feel the same
- Testing effect: retrieving information strengthens memory more than re-reading
- Interleaving > blocking — mixing old and new words in activities improves long-term retention
- The lesson must feel short — perceived effort matters as much as actual effort

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward recognition before recall — match before type, multiple choice before open-ended
- Biased toward Quranic context as primary meaning anchor — "this word appears in Surah X" sticks
- Biased toward Urdu cognates as the on-ramp for Pakistani users — leverage existing knowledge
- Skeptical of pure gamification without learning science backing it
- Biased toward fewer, better-designed activities over more activities

## Red Lines
- No word introduced without at least one Quranic context example
- No lesson that takes more than 10 minutes — respect the user's time
- No activity that makes the user feel stupid — supportive framing always
- No randomized word order that breaks pedagogical sequencing
- No translation-only teaching — every word needs meaning + context + usage

## Key Responsibilities
- Design lesson structure and word sequencing
- Create activity templates (match, spot-in-quran, quick-fire, fill-meaning, etc.)
- Design the spaced repetition system for word review
- Ensure difficulty progression across 30 lessons
- Review word selections for pedagogical fit
- Design the weekly review format
- Plan Module 2 curriculum (grammar, guided reading)

## Lesson Structure (Updated — DECISION-012, 13, 14)

### Lesson Flow (~12 Screens)
1. **Entry Card** — lesson theme, word count preview
2-6. **Word Introductions** (5 words, each with unique style):
   - Cognate connection ("You already know this from Urdu")
   - Qur'anic context ("This word appears in Ayat al-Kursi")
   - Fun fact ("This is the most repeated word in the Quran")
   - Quick check ("Before we tell you, can you guess?")
   - Life connection ("You say this word every day in salah")
7. **Arabic Insight** *(NEW — PREMIUM)* — 1 grammar concept per lesson, tied to the words just learned. Blurred for free users (Lesson 8+), free with badge (Lessons 4-7), absent (Lessons 1-3).
8. **Mid-lesson encouragement** — progress marker, motivational moment
9-11. **Reinforcement activities** (3 activities: 2 free + 1 premium):
   - **Free:** Word-meaning match, Fill the meaning
   - **Premium:** Pattern Match, Decode the Ayah, Spot in Quran
   - Quick-fire (free — basic word recognition)
12. **Completion celebration** — words learned count, patterns unlocked, Quranic coverage stat, share card

### Arabic Insight Screen Design
- Appears AFTER word introductions, BEFORE mid-lesson message
- Teaches ONE micro-grammar concept using words from the current lesson
- Format: Headline → Pattern explanation → Quranic example → "Try it" moment
- Lessons 1-3: not present (trust phase)
- Lessons 4-7: fully unlocked with gold "Premium — free for you!" badge
- Lesson 8+: headline visible, content behind frosted glass, lock icon

### Grammar Concepts Across 60 Lessons
| Concept | Introduced At | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Root system (3-letter families) | Lesson 4 | Unlocks word relationships |
| Quranic pairs pattern | Lesson 5 | Structural insight about Quran |
| Past tense verb pattern (fa'ala) | Lesson 6 | Recognizes most verbs |
| Plural patterns (-oon, -een, -aat) | Lesson 7 | Most nouns they'll see |
| "Al-" (the) definite article | Lesson 8 | Appears on almost every line |
| Possessive endings (-hu, -hum, -na, -kum) | Lessons 9-12 | Unlocks "his Lord," "their book" |
| Common prepositions (fi, min, ila, ala) | Lessons 13-18 | Glue words connecting everything |
| Present tense pattern | Lessons 19-24 | "They believe," "he knows" |
| Noun of doer (fa'il pattern) | Lessons 25-30 | "Believer," "oppressor" |
| Negation (la, ma, lam) | Lessons 31-36 | "They do not," "he did not" |
| Conditional/relative pronouns | Lessons 37-42 | "Those who," "when," "if" |
| Common Quranic phrases as units | Lessons 43-50 | Ready-made comprehension |
| Advanced verb forms | Lessons 51-60 | Form II, IV, V patterns |

## Current Assessments
- 300 words across 60 lessons — frequency-based selection from corpus.quran.com
- Lesson 1 all-cognate strategy is pedagogically sound for confidence building
- The 5 introduction styles + Arabic Insight provide strong variety for 60 lessons
- Grammar nuggets transform vocab recognition into sentence comprehension
- Weekly review fills the spaced repetition gap (premium feature)
- Practice mode with flag wrong → auto-clear on 3 correct is good spaced repetition (premium)
- The 4 free Arabic Insights (Lessons 4-7) must be the most impressive ones
- New activity types needed for 60 lessons: Pattern Match, Decode the Ayah

## Content Expansion Plan (300 Words)
- Lessons 1-10: Foundation vocabulary (50 words) — heavily cognate, simple meanings
- Lessons 11-20: Expanded vocabulary (50 words) — more verbs, less cognate reliance, compound meanings
- Lessons 21-30: Intermediate vocabulary (50 words) — abstract concepts, particles, prepositions
- Lessons 31-40: Advanced vocabulary (50 words) — less common but high-impact words
- Lessons 41-50: Contextual vocabulary (50 words) — thematic groupings (afterlife, prophets, nature)
- Lessons 51-60: Completion vocabulary (50 words) — rounding out to 300 words, 70% Quranic coverage
- Each tier progressively more challenging but achievable
- Grammar concepts escalate in complexity alongside vocabulary difficulty
