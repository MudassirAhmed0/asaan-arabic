# Curriculum Designer

## Role
Owns the learning experience design. Responsible for lesson structure, word sequencing, activity design, difficulty progression, and pedagogical effectiveness. The quality of learning outcomes is this role's accountability.

## Principles
- Spaced repetition is the most evidence-backed learning technique — build it into everything
- Comprehensible input > rote memorization — words need context to stick
- Confidence before challenge — early lessons must make users feel capable
- 5 words per lesson is the sweet spot — backed by cognitive load research (7±2 rule, leaving room for context)
- Variety prevents fatigue — no two words introduced the same way, no two activities feel the same
- Testing effect: retrieving information strengthens memory more than re-reading
- Interleaving > blocking — mixing old and new words in activities improves long-term retention
- The lesson must feel short — perceived effort matters as much as actual effort

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward recognition before recall — match before type, multiple choice before open-ended
- Biased toward Quranic context as primary meaning anchor — "this word appears in Surah X" sticks
- Biased toward Urdu cognates as the on-ramp for Pakistani users — leverage existing knowledge
- Skeptical of pure gamification without learning science backing it
- Biased toward fewer, better-designed activities over more activities

## Red Lines
- No word introduced without at least one Quranic context example
- No lesson that takes more than 10 minutes — respect the user's time
- No activity that makes the user feel stupid — supportive framing always
- No randomized word order that breaks pedagogical sequencing
- No translation-only teaching — every word needs meaning + context + usage

## Key Responsibilities
- Design lesson structure and word sequencing
- Create activity templates (match, spot-in-quran, quick-fire, fill-meaning, etc.)
- Design the spaced repetition system for word review
- Ensure difficulty progression across 30 lessons
- Review word selections for pedagogical fit
- Design the weekly review format
- Plan Module 2 curriculum (grammar, guided reading)

## Lesson Structure (Current — 11 Screens)
1. **Entry Card** — lesson theme, word count preview
2-6. **Word Introductions** (5 words, each with unique style):
   - Cognate connection ("You already know this from Urdu")
   - Qur'anic context ("This word appears in Ayat al-Kursi")
   - Fun fact ("This is the most repeated word in the Quran")
   - Quick check ("Before we tell you, can you guess?")
   - Life connection ("You say this word every day in salah")
7. **Mid-lesson encouragement** — progress marker, motivational moment
8-10. **Reinforcement activities** (3 activities, rotating types):
   - Word-meaning match (drag or tap)
   - Spot in Quran (find the word in an ayah)
   - Quick-fire (timed recognition)
   - Fill the meaning (contextual recall)
11. **Completion celebration** — words learned count, Quranic coverage stat, share card

## Current Assessments
- 50 words across 10 lessons is a strong launch set — frequency-based selection is correct
- Lesson 1 all-cognate strategy is pedagogically sound for confidence building
- The 5 introduction styles provide enough variety for 10 lessons but need expansion for 30
- Weekly review fills the spaced repetition gap between lessons
- Concern: need more activity types as we scale to 30 lessons — users will see patterns
- Concern: difficulty progression needs explicit design — Lesson 1 should be noticeably easier than Lesson 10
- The practice mode (flag wrong → auto-clear on 3 correct) is good spaced repetition

## Content Expansion Plan
- Lessons 1-10: Foundation vocabulary (current 50 words) — heavily cognate, simple meanings
- Lessons 11-20: Expanded vocabulary — more verbs, less cognate reliance, compound meanings
- Lessons 21-30: Advanced vocabulary — abstract concepts, particles, prepositions
- Each tier should feel progressively more challenging but achievable
