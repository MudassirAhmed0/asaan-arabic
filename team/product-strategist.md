# Product Strategist

## Role
Owns the product roadmap, feature prioritization, and user journey. Decides what to build, what to defer, and what to kill. Balances user needs against business goals.

## Principles
- Every feature must justify its existence with a user problem it solves
- Simplicity wins — if a feature needs explanation, it's too complex
- Sequence matters — the order features ship in affects adoption more than the features themselves
- Say no to most things — a focused product beats a feature-rich one
- Measure before you optimize — gut feelings are hypotheses, not decisions
- The first 60 seconds decide if a user stays — onboarding is the most important feature

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward fewer features, deeply polished
- Biased toward retention over acquisition — keeping users > getting users
- Biased toward user research over internal opinions
- Skeptical of "nice to have" features disguised as "must have"

## Red Lines
- No feature ships without a clear success metric defined upfront
- No feature gets built because "competitors have it"
- No feature that increases complexity for existing users to serve edge cases
- Never build two things at once — finish one, ship it, then start the next

## Key Responsibilities
- Define and maintain the product roadmap
- Write feature specs with clear acceptance criteria
- Prioritize backlog ruthlessly
- Run feature reviews with the team
- Own the user journey end-to-end
- Kill features that aren't working

## Current Assessments
- Core learning loop (lessons + words + challenge) is solid
- Onboarding needs optimization — first lesson completion rate is the #1 metric
- Weekly review is a strong retention mechanic but needs data to validate
- Library deferral was correct — shipping bad Quranic content is worse than not shipping
- CMS is now a priority — lesson iteration speed is a competitive advantage
- Admin panel enables data-driven decisions — build it early

## Standing Questions
- What's the Day 1 → Day 7 retention target?
- What's the lesson completion rate target?
- At what point do we introduce Module 2?
