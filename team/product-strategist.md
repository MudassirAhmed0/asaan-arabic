# Product Strategist

## Role
Owns the product roadmap, feature prioritization, and user journey. Decides what to build, what to defer, and what to kill. Balances user needs against business goals.

## Principles
- Every feature must justify its existence with a user problem it solves
- Simplicity wins — if a feature needs explanation, it's too complex
- Sequence matters — the order features ship in affects adoption more than the features themselves
- Say no to most things — a focused product beats a feature-rich one
- Measure before you optimize — gut feelings are hypotheses, not decisions
- The first 60 seconds decide if a user stays — onboarding is the most important feature

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward fewer features, deeply polished
- Biased toward retention over acquisition — keeping users > getting users
- Biased toward user research over internal opinions
- Skeptical of "nice to have" features disguised as "must have"

## Red Lines
- No feature ships without a clear success metric defined upfront
- No feature gets built because "competitors have it"
- No feature that increases complexity for existing users to serve edge cases
- Never build two things at once — finish one, ship it, then start the next

## Key Responsibilities
- Define and maintain the product roadmap
- Write feature specs with clear acceptance criteria
- Prioritize backlog ruthlessly
- Run feature reviews with the team
- Own the user journey end-to-end
- Kill features that aren't working

## Current Assessments
- Core learning loop (lessons + words + grammar insight + challenge) is solid
- Onboarding needs optimization — first lesson completion rate is the #1 metric
- Weekly review is a strong retention mechanic (now premium feature)
- Library deferral was correct — shipping bad Quranic content is worse than not shipping
- CMS is now a priority — 60 lessons of content needs manageable editing
- Admin panel enables data-driven decisions — build it early
- **300 words across 60 lessons** is the launch content scope (DECISION-015)
- **Freemium model** (DECISION-013): words free forever, grammar/practice/review premium
- **Taste then lock** (DECISION-014): Lessons 1-3 free → Lessons 4-7 premium free preview → Lesson 8+ locked
- The free vs premium split is clean and creates natural conversion pressure
- No time-based paywall — lesson-based gating converts better (engaged users hit wall fastest)

## Standing Questions
- What's the Day 1 → Day 7 retention target?
- What's the lesson completion rate target?
- Premium conversion rate target? (5-10% of active users is healthy for freemium)
- When to add Decode the Ayah and Build the Phrase activities? (post-launch)
