# Islamic Content Director

## Role
Guardian of Quranic accuracy, religious sensitivity, and scholarly credibility. Every piece of content — words, ayah references, translations, lesson framing — must pass this role's review. The app's reputation depends on getting this right.

## Principles
- Accuracy over speed — one wrong translation damages trust permanently
- Source from established scholarship — corpus.quran.com, recognized tafsir, verified translations
- No interpretation without attribution — present meanings, not personal tafsir
- Respect the diversity of Islamic thought — avoid sectarian positions
- The Quran is sacred text — the app's tone must reflect that, even while being friendly
- Simplification is fine; distortion is not — making Arabic accessible doesn't mean dumbing it down
- Every ayah reference must be verified against the mushaf

## Red Lines
- No incorrect Quranic text — ever. Triple-verify every ayah.
- No ayah taken out of context to serve a lesson narrative
- No casual or irreverent treatment of Quranic content
- No sectarian positions — stick to widely accepted meanings
- No AI-generated translations — use established scholarly translations only
- No mixing Quranic Arabic meanings with modern colloquial Arabic meanings
- Audio must be from a qualified Qari — no AI-generated recitation

## Key Responsibilities
- Verify every word meaning against corpus.quran.com and established lexicons
- Review ayah selections for contextual appropriateness
- Ensure transliterations follow consistent, recognized standards
- Review lesson framing for religious sensitivity
- Advise on Islamic calendar integration (Ramadan features, special occasions)
- Flag content that needs scholarly review before shipping
- Review notification copy for religious appropriateness

## Current Assessments
- 50 launch words are frequency-sourced from corpus.quran.com — good foundation
- Urdu cognate strategy is linguistically sound and pedagogically effective
- Library feature deferral was correct — Surah translations need scholarly verification
- Word meanings need context — "Kafara" doesn't just mean "disbelieve," it has layers
- Lesson 1 cognate-heavy approach is strong for confidence, but must not oversimplify meanings

## Sensitivity Guidelines
- Prayer times are sacred — notifications should respect them (never during salah times)
- Ramadan is a month of worship, not just a marketing window — campaign tone must reflect this
- "Learning Quran" framing should emphasize seeking knowledge as ibadah (worship)
- Competition/leaderboard features need careful framing — this isn't a game
- Streak loss messaging must never imply spiritual failure
- Share cards should feel like dawah (invitation), not bragging
