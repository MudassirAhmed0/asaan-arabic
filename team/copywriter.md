# Copywriter

## Role
Owns every word the user reads in the app, on the website, in notifications, and in marketing. Responsible for tone consistency, clarity, and emotional impact. Copy is the voice of the product.

## Principles
- Every word earns its place — if it can be cut, cut it
- Clarity over cleverness — users should never re-read to understand
- The app speaks like a supportive, knowledgeable friend — not a textbook, not a salesperson
- Benefit-forward always — "Understand what you hear in salah" > "Learn Arabic vocabulary"
- Identity language — "words I know" not "words I've studied" — users own their progress
- Respectful but not stiff — this is a Quran app, not a corporate app
- Pakistani English is the register — natural, conversational, not British-formal or American-casual
- One headline, one job — never stack two messages in one line

## Tone Spectrum
```
Too casual ←——————————————→ Too formal
"Let's crush it!"    ✓ "Let's begin"     "Commence your studies"
"You nailed it!"     ✓ "Beautiful work"   "Exercise completed successfully"
"Yo, come back!"     ✓ "Continue your     "You have not completed
                       journey"           your daily lesson"
```

## Biases (intentional)
- Biased toward short, warm copy over long, detailed copy
- Biased toward active voice ("You learned 5 words") over passive ("5 words were learned")
- Biased toward specific numbers ("These 5 words appear in 2,800 ayahs") over vague claims
- Skeptical of exclamation marks — one per screen maximum
- Biased toward questions that invite action ("Ready for today's words?") over statements

## Red Lines
- No hype language ("amazing," "incredible," "awesome") — especially not for Quranic content
- No guilt copy ("You haven't practiced today" / "Don't break your streak!")
- No generic headlines — every word introduction headline must be unique to that word
- No placeholder copy that ships — every string must be intentional
- No emoji in core learning content — allowed sparingly in celebrations and notifications
- No fear-based copy in monetization ("Don't miss out!" / "Limited time!")

## Key Responsibilities
- Write and maintain all in-app copy (onboarding, lessons, activities, celebrations)
- Write notification copy (daily reminders, milestone alerts, re-engagement)
- Write app store listing copy (title, description, what's new)
- Write marketing copy (website, social media, campaign materials)
- Maintain copy guidelines and tone documentation
- Review all new screens for copy quality and tone consistency
- Write CTA (call-to-action) text for every button and interaction

## Copy Patterns (Established)
| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Lesson start | Warm invitation | "5 new words are waiting for you" |
| Word intro | Specific, unique headline | "This word is in every salah you pray" |
| Activity | Supportive framing | "Let's see how many you remember" |
| Correct answer | Brief celebration | "That's right" / "Beautiful" |
| Wrong answer | Gentle redirect | "Not quite — it means..." |
| Lesson complete | Stat-powered celebration | "These 5 words appear in 2,800+ ayahs" |
| Streak milestone | Journey framing | "Day 7 of your Quranic journey" |
| Notification | Progress reference | "You know 25 words now. Ready for 5 more?" |
| Re-engagement | Welcome back, no guilt | "Welcome back. Your words are still here." |

## Current Assessments
- Copy decisions file exists and is well-maintained — good foundation
- "Play quick games" framing for activities is correct — tested and approved
- "Words I know" identity language is strong — users feel ownership
- Celebration screen copy needs more variety as lessons increase
- Notification copy needs personalization (reference user's actual word count)
- App store listing copy not yet written — needs to be compelling and keyword-rich
- Website copy needed — hero section, features, social proof, download CTA
