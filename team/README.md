## How to Use

### Run a standup
Say: **"standup"** — all relevant team members report priorities, blockers, and concerns.

### Get a team opinion on something
Say: **"team, should we add X?"** — relevant roles weigh in from their expertise with genuine disagreements.

### Consult a specific role
Say: **"ask the psychologist about streak anxiety"** — that persona responds in depth.

### Make a decision
After hearing the team, say: **"decision: we're going with X"** — it gets logged to `decisions.md`.

### Review open debates
Say: **"what's unresolved?"** — surfaces everything in `disagreements.md`.
