# Daily Standup Log

Record of team standups. Each entry captures what each role reported, decisions made, and action items.

## How to Run a Standup

Say **"standup"** or **"daily standup"** and the relevant team members will report:
1. What they'd prioritize right now
2. Blockers or concerns
3. Recommendations or flags for CEO

Disagreements are surfaced explicitly. CEO makes final calls. Everything is logged here.

## Standups

### Standup #1 — 2026-02-01

**Attendees:** All 12 roles

**Key Issues Surfaced:**
1. App name not decided — blocks marketing, website, app store listing (Growth, Copywriter)
2. Feature 4 uncommitted — needs Mudassir's manual test first (Product, Engineering)
3. Firebase + push notifications not started — #1 retention lever missing (Psychologist, Engineering)
4. Only 10 lessons for 30-day Ramadan — content pipeline is the bottleneck (Curriculum, Islamic Content)
5. Zero analytics infrastructure — launching blind (Data Analyst)
6. Qari audio status unknown — no audio = quality gap (Islamic Content)
7. Hosting decision still open — can't deploy without it (Engineering)
8. Pre-Ramadan campaign window shrinking — needs to start this week (Growth)
9. CMS/admin/website vs app launch sequencing — scope creep risk (Product)
10. Streak freeze/grace period not designed (Psychologist)

**Disagreements:**
- Product Strategist vs Growth Lead on CMS timing: Product says ship app first, Growth says website is needed for launch (app store requires URLs). **Resolution needed from CEO.**
- Data Analyst vs Engineering Lead on admin panel priority: Data says analytics dashboard first, Engineering says CMS first. **Resolution needed from CEO.**

**CEO Decisions (all 10 resolved):**
1. App name: **Asaan Arabic** — Tagline: **"Samajh ke Parho"** [DECISION-001]
2. Uncommitted code is tested — commit it [DECISION-002]
3. Push notifications: just before or after beta launch [DECISION-003]
4. 10 lessons for beta, expand after feedback [DECISION-004]
5. Analytics: plan and build now [DECISION-005]
6. Beta launches without Qari audio [DECISION-006]
7. Hosting: **Railway** [DECISION-007]
8. Campaign starts **Monday Feb 9th** [DECISION-008]
9. **Build everything — no scope cuts.** CMS, admin, website, app — all in parallel [DECISION-009]
10. Streak freeze: design the plan [DECISION-010]

**Disagreements Resolved:**
- CMS timing: CEO overruled Product Strategist — build everything now, no sequencing cuts
- Admin priority: CEO says both analytics AND CMS — no either/or

- [ ] Commit all tested changes (Engineering)
- [ ] Behavioral Psychologist to present streak freeze plan
- [ ] Data Analyst + Engineering Lead to plan analytics infrastructure
