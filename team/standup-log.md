# Daily Standup Log

Record of team standups. Each entry captures what each role reported, decisions made, and action items.

## How to Run a Standup

Say **"standup"** or **"daily standup"** and the relevant team members will report:
1. **Priorities, blockers, flags** — each role reports what they'd prioritize, blockers, and recommendations for CEO
2. **Instagram / content performance** — Growth Lead + Data Analyst + Copywriter review latest post metrics vs baseline (Post 1 baseline: 502 views, 14 likes, 6 saves, 3 shares | Post 2 baseline: 163 views, 11 likes, 1 save, 2 shares). Flag what hooks, timing, and CTAs are working. Accumulate learnings for next week's content planning.
3. **Website / page performance** — Growth Lead + Data Analyst review traffic, conversions, subscriber signups, and any issues
4. **Learnings log** — capture week-over-week insights from content + page performance that feed into next planning cycle

**Ownership:**
- Growth Lead owns content performance tracking and campaign alignment
- Data Analyst owns metrics comparison and trend spotting
- Copywriter owns hook/CTA analysis and copy recommendations
- These three personas carry context across standups and ensure learnings feed into next week's plan

Disagreements are surfaced explicitly. CEO makes final calls. Everything is logged here.

**Retention:** Keep only the last 7 days of standups in this file. Older entries are removed to keep the log lean and relevant.

## Week of Feb 3–9, 2026

### Standup #2 — 2026-02-03

**Attendees:** All 12 roles

**Priorities, Blockers, Flags:**
- Firebase setup still not started — blocks push notifications (Engineering, Psychologist)
- Feature 8 partial — needs to close out for beta (Product, Engineering)
- App store accounts + listing submission needed this week — Apple review lead time (Growth, Copywriter)
- Website must be live before Feb 9 campaign (Growth, Engineering)
- Streak freeze design still pending (Psychologist)
- No app-side analytics yet — launching blind on user behavior (Data Analyst)

**Instagram / Content Performance:**
- Baseline established from Feb 2 posts:
  - Post 1 (Taraweeh, 6am): 502 views, 209 reach, 14 likes, 6 saves, 3 shares, 0 comments
  - Post 2 (Cognates, 7pm): 163 views, 66 reach, 11 likes, 1 save, 2 shares, 0 comments
- Ramadan/emotional hook outperformed educational hook 3x
- 16 followers, 233 organic views — 14x reach-to-follower ratio (strong algorithm signal)
- Zero comments — "tag someone" CTA didn't convert
- This week's content is aligned and planned. Daily posting continues.

**Website / Page Performance (as of Feb 3):**
- Visitors: 30 | Page Views: 39 | Bounce Rate: 77%
- Subscribers: 4 (13.3% conversion — solid for pre-launch)
- Traffic: Instagram (4 visitors), Google Quick Search Box (some organic)
- Geo: Mostly Pakistan, small diaspora — Singapore 7%, Brazil 3%, Canada 3%
- Devices: 66% mobile, 34% desktop
- Instagram → website funnel leaking: 665 post views → 4 referrals (~0.6% click-through on "link in bio")
- 77% bounce rate — above-the-fold copy not holding visitors
- Subscriber list: 4 emails (ahmed@empirepixel.com, ahmedzarrar07@gmail.com, syedobaidaly@gmail.com, zaib83236@gmail.com)

**Learnings Log:**
1. Emotional/Ramadan angle >> educational/fun-fact angle
2. Morning posts (6am) outperform evening (7pm)
3. "Save this" CTA likely better than "tag someone" — saves already outperform shares organically
4. Distribution is strong for a 16-follower account — content is reaching non-followers

**Top 5 Priorities:**
1. Firebase setup (Mudassir action)
2. App store account prep + listing submission
3. Website live before Feb 9
4. Feature 8 completion
5. Start logging Instagram metrics daily as baseline

**Blockers on Mudassir:**
- Firebase project setup — not started
- Qari recording session — not scheduled
- App store developer accounts — unknown status
- Campaign content direction — 6 days to Feb 9

**Open Disagreement:**
- Curriculum Designer flags 10 lessons may run out mid-Ramadan. Current plan: ship 10, add more during Ramadan. Needs CEO call if changing approach.

### Standup #1 — 2026-02-01 (Week of Jan 27–Feb 2)

**Attendees:** All 12 roles

**Key Issues Surfaced:**
1. App name not decided — blocks marketing, website, app store listing (Growth, Copywriter)
2. Feature 4 uncommitted — needs Mudassir's manual test first (Product, Engineering)
3. Firebase + push notifications not started — #1 retention lever missing (Psychologist, Engineering)
4. Only 10 lessons for 30-day Ramadan — content pipeline is the bottleneck (Curriculum, Islamic Content)
5. Zero analytics infrastructure — launching blind (Data Analyst)
6. Qari audio status unknown — no audio = quality gap (Islamic Content)
7. Hosting decision still open — can't deploy without it (Engineering)
8. Pre-Ramadan campaign window shrinking — needs to start this week (Growth)
9. CMS/admin/website vs app launch sequencing — scope creep risk (Product)
10. Streak freeze/grace period not designed (Psychologist)

**Disagreements:**
- Product Strategist vs Growth Lead on CMS timing: Product says ship app first, Growth says website is needed for launch (app store requires URLs). **Resolution needed from CEO.**
- Data Analyst vs Engineering Lead on admin panel priority: Data says analytics dashboard first, Engineering says CMS first. **Resolution needed from CEO.**

**CEO Decisions (all 10 resolved):**
1. App name: **Asaan Arabic** — Tagline: **"Samajh ke Parho"** [DECISION-001]
2. Uncommitted code is tested — commit it [DECISION-002]
3. Push notifications: just before or after beta launch [DECISION-003]
4. 10 lessons for beta, expand after feedback [DECISION-004]
5. Analytics: plan and build now [DECISION-005]
6. Beta launches without Qari audio [DECISION-006]
7. Hosting: **Railway** [DECISION-007]
8. Campaign starts **Monday Feb 9th** [DECISION-008]
9. **Build everything — no scope cuts.** CMS, admin, website, app — all in parallel [DECISION-009]
10. Streak freeze: design the plan [DECISION-010]

**Disagreements Resolved:**
- CMS timing: CEO overruled Product Strategist — build everything now, no sequencing cuts
- Admin priority: CEO says both analytics AND CMS — no either/or

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Commit all tested changes (Engineering)
- [ ] Behavioral Psychologist to present streak freeze plan
- [ ] Data Analyst + Engineering Lead to plan analytics infrastructure
- [ ] Growth Lead to prepare campaign content for Feb 9th launch
- [ ] Copywriter to draft app store listing copy with new name
- [ ] Engineering Lead to plan CMS, admin panel, website architecture
