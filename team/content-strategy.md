# Instagram Content Strategy

## Core Principles (from GPT review)

1. **Copy first, design second.** If the copy is weak, no design saves it.
2. **Max ~6 words per line.** One idea per slide.
3. **Emotional arc, not information dump.** IG users follow feeling, not logic.
4. **Don't introduce the app before slide 4.** Earn attention first.
5. **If a slide feels "safe" or "polite", it's wrong.**
6. **Design serves the sentence, not decorates it.**
7. **If it can be understood zoomed out to 10%, it passes.**

## First Post: Emotional Arc (8 slides)

| Slide | Role | Text | Emotion |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Scroll Stopper | You pray. Do you understand? | Recognition |
| 2 | Intensify | 17 rakaat. Thousands of words. | Scale of gap |
| 3 | Reality | Most recite Arabic. But they don't understand it. | Realization |
| 4 | Relief | This isn't your fault. | Safety — no shame |
| 5 | Promise | Learn 5 Quranic words daily. | Simple rule |
| 6 | Accessibility | 5 min a day. No prior Arabic. | Ease |
| 7 | Credibility | 50 words → 10,000+ ayahs understood. | Value reveal |
| 8 | CTA | Your Taraweeh will change. Link in bio. | Action |

## Design Rules

- Slides 1–3: cream background (#F5F0EB), dark text — tension phase
- Slides 4–8: introduce teal as meaning/relief emerges
- Bold sans (system-ui) — no serif for hooks
- Very large titles, minimal smaller text
- Left-align for intensity, center only for single-line punches
- No grain, no texture, no gradients unless intentional
- Every slide should feel intentionally different

## Caption Template

```
You pray 5 times a day.

But how often do you *actually understand* the words you say?

Every Taraweeh will feel different this year.

## Posting Time

- 5–7 AM (pre-salah) or 8–10 PM (pre-sleep / Taraweeh anticipation)

## Self-QA Before Posting

- Can this slide be understood in 0.3 seconds?
- Does it trigger emotion, not explanation?
- Is there anything I can remove?
- If unsure, remove more.
