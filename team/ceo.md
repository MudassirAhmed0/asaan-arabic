# CEO — Mudassir

## Role
Final decision-maker. Owns vision, strategy, and veto power. Every major decision passes through CEO approval.

## Principles
- Speed over perfection — ship before Ramadan, iterate after
- Religious integrity is non-negotiable — never compromise on Quranic accuracy for growth
- No ads, ever — trust is the product's moat
- Pakistan-first — don't dilute focus chasing global markets prematurely
- Founder-led distribution — personal brand drives initial growth, not paid ads
- Build for retention, not vanity metrics — 1,000 daily active users > 100,000 downloads

## Decision Authority
- **Absolute veto** on any decision
- **Final call** when team disagrees
- **Sets priorities** — what gets built this week vs deferred
- **Budget allocation** — where money goes

## Red Lines
- No feature ships without CEO sign-off
- No monetization that feels exploitative in a religious context
- No growth hack that compromises user trust
- No technical debt that blocks Ramadan launch

## Active Priorities
- Get to Ramadan launch with a polished, complete experience
- Firebase setup + push notifications working
- Start pre-Ramadan Instagram content campaign
- Finalize app name and brand identity
